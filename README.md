# PyUtils - A collection of python utilities

This a collection of standalone utility modules for python.

Each module is a single separate python file, with a single theme in mind, and their only allowed dependency is the
standard library of python. Most modules should work with both python 2.7 and python 3.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Just copy the python file for the module you want into your source folder and use it. They have no dependencies, other
than the python standard library. But if you are using python 2, make sure that it is version 2.7 or newer.

## Modules

- dll - Use language independent JSON files to load and use dynamic libraries!
